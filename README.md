## Pie Charts vs Square Pie Charts vs Stacked Bars

> Pies and donuts are no different, though both are worse than the square pie chart.

## Pie Charts

Pie charts are misleading: position and color of slices affects our judgments
of their size. Prefer bar charts to pie charts.

## Animated Graphics

Many people are change-blind to animated graphics, especially those
that abruptly transition between colors and shapes. Animating value changes
improves the awareness and measurement of change.

A popular industry application of this research is [d3js](http://d3js.org/)'s
staggered transitions [as seen in its showreel](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3943967).

## Animating Pan & Zoom

> Large 2D information spaces, such as maps, images, or abstract visualizations,
> require views at various level of detail: Close ups to
> inspect details, overviews to maintain (literally) an overview. Users
> often switch between these views. We discuss how smooth animations
> from one view to another can be defined. To this end, a
> metric on the effect of simultaneous zooming and panning is defined,
> based on an estimate of the perceived velocity

The proposed algorithm, which is implemented in [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) 0.8,
and [Mapbox GL](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl/), presents a way to pan and
zoom that is less jarring and easier to follow that simple linear interpolation
of both variables. The paper doesn't discuss cognitive benefits, but
the results are often perceived as more pleasant than the simple way.

## Treemaps

[Perceptual Guidelines for Creating Rectangular Treemaps](http://vis.stanford.edu/files/2010-Treemaps-InfoVis.pdf)
by Nicholas Kong, Jeffrey Heer, and Maneesh Agrawala

* the optimal distribution of rectangle aspect ratios within a treemap should include non-squares, but should avoid extreme aspect ratios.
* even at relatively low data densities treemaps result in faster comparisons than
  bar charts.

## Colors

> use hue to show categorical differences and use lightness to show
> lightness differences

[Color Use Guidelines for Data Representation](http://www.personal.psu.edu/cab38/Pub_scans/Brewer_1999_Color-Use-Guidelines-ASAproc.pdf)

Avoid interpolating color palettes using RGB values, because the hue
and brightness of colors within that system are strongly linked. Instead,
use perceptual color spaces like CIE.

[Generating Color Palettes using Intuitive Parameters](http://magnaview.nl/documents/MagnaView-M_Wijffelaars-Generating_color_palettes_using_intuitive_parameters.pdf) &
[How to Avoid Equidistant Colors](http://vis4.net/blog/posts/avoid-equidistant-hsv-colors/)

When choosing map and visualization colors, check that your color scheme is colorblind friendly and [ADA: Section 508 compliant](http://www.hhs.gov/web/508/accessiblefiles/checklisthtml.html).  [ColorBrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/) and [WebAIM Contrast Color](http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) are great resources to check colorblind safe, print friendly, and photocopy safe color schemes.

As [Eric Fischer's research into colorblindness simulation reveals](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/colorblind-simulation/), the traditional formulas for simulating colorblindness and choosing safe combinations don't match to the reality of colorblind perception.

## Chart Types

* [Horizon charts](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/time_on_the_horizon.pdf) improve recognition of both small and large changes for data that fits x & y axes, like time series
* [Chord diagrams](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2009/06/15/gr.092759.109.full.pdf+html) enable visualization of multi-dimensional and connected data
* [Sankey diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram) depict flow from one set of values to another.
* [Candlestick charts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlestick_chart) is a style of financial chart used to describe price movements of a security, derivative, or currency.
* [Scatter charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/image/docs/gallery/scatter_charts) are comprised of individual dots on a two-dimensional chart. Scatter charts are good for detecting groupings or patterns in many data points that have two variables (if you have only one variable, consider a line chart).
* [Sparklines](http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001OR) are “small intense, simple, word-sized graphic with typographic resolution.”
* [Stacked Graphs](http://www.leebyron.com/else/streamgraph/) also known as streamgraphs, which gained popularity with ThemeRiver and its
  visualization of last.fm data. An alternative to stacked area charts,
  they can thrive with series that vary and disappear over time.
